This package adds =XOAuth2= authentication capabilities to ~auth-source~.

This integration requires some preliminary work on the users' part, which
includes creating tokens that the package will use. For more details,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x describe-variable auth-source-xoauth2-creds
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once all tokens are obtained, adding

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(auth-source-xoauth2-enable)
#+END_EXAMPLE

to your configuration will enable =XOAuth2= mechanisms in both IMAP and SNMP.
For more details, see

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x describe-function auth-source-xoauth2-enable
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you want to use the package with other services, the
~auth-source-xoauth2-enable~ function will probably have to be modified to add
the necessary protocol compatibility hooks: the existing contents should serve
as a guide, and I would be happy to include contributions in this package.

Note: This package /does/ work with Emacs 25.1, even though it requires 26.1 in
the package description. That requirement is necessary in order to silence
linter errors. If using Emacs 25.1, the ~auth-source-pass~ package is optional.

* Debugging

If things are not working, the first thing to do is probably to try
and get a refresh token manually. This can be done with =curl= as
follows (replace the values with your particular ones, and remember to
quote whatever needs quoting):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
curl -X POST \
  '<token-url>&client_id=<client-id>&client_secret=<client-secret>&refresh_token=<refresh-token>&grant_type=refresh_token'
#+END_SRC

This should get you a reply that includes an access token. If it
doesn't, failures will hopefully include error messages that tell you
what to do. In the following case, you need to re-generate the refresh token:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
{
  "error": "invalid_grant",
  "error_description": "Token has been expired or revoked."
}
#+END_EXAMPLE
